# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project developed in
Google Colab to predict laptop prices using various regression models,
including a stacking ensemble.

## Project Workflow
- Data overview and initial inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Log transformation of target variable
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Stacking ensemble model
- Model interpretability using LIME

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Notes
The dataset must be uploaded manually when running the notebook in
Google Colab.
